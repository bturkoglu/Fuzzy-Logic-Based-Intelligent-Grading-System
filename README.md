ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a fuzzy logic-based grading system designed to evaluate university student performance more flexibly and fairly than traditional threshold-based methods. The system processes midterm, final, and quiz scores, converting them into linguistic categories (Low, Average, High, Excellent) using fuzzy inference rules and membership functions.

âœ¨ Key Features:

âœ… Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for grade classification
âœ… Triangular & Trapezoidal Membership Functions for flexible evaluation
âœ… Expert-defined fuzzy rules for intelligent grading
âœ… Python-based implementation for easy adaptation
âœ… Scalable for different grading policies
